### ABOUT

Humba Ventures is a pre-seed and seed fund in the [Susa Ventures](https://www.susaventures.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} family. While Susa Ventures is focused on leading early stage rounds in traditional sectors like enterprise SaaS, fintech, healthcare, and logistics, Humba Ventures is mainly focused on smaller, emerging sectors and technologies like robotics and manufacturing, climate and energy, and defense and security. Humba also occasionally invests as a supportive, non-lead investor in traditional sectors.

Humba typically writes $250k-$750k core checks with a high engagement model, and occasionally writes $50k-$100k scout checks.

We bring over a decade of institutional VC experience developed through supporting companies like Robinhood, Flexport, and Mux at their earliest stages, and apply that experience to founders building companies at the frontiers of technology.

### WORKING WITH HUMBA VENTURES

We try to do monthly syncs with every core check founder, and of course we’re always available ad hoc whenever anything urgent comes up.

Our approach is to be actively helpful and supportive without being meddlesome or getting in the way. We're laid back and nonjudgmental -- whether things are going well or not, we're not going to add to your stress; we're just going to roll up our sleeves to help wherever we can.

Areas where we can help:

FUNDRAISING SUPPORT
* We'll iterate on the deck content together, then introduce you to designers when the deck is ready for final touches.
* We'll do pitch practice sessions together until you're comfortable with the pitch.
* We'll introduce you to the best investors for you -- both the well known ones that everyone wants to talk to, and the under the radar investors that have deep experience in the category you're focused on.
 
STRATEGIC SUPPORT
* We'll provide feedback on your product, website, marketing copy, etc. whenever you want.
* We can help with GTM design and strategy.
* We'll help you level up your product's pricing.
* We're good thought partners for general company strategy: thinking about product roadmaps, moat development, navigating against key competitors, etc.

HIRING SUPPORT
* We help with sourcing whenever we meet a great candidate that could be a fit for your company.
* We can help with recruiting process design, job spec reviews, and comp planning.
* We'll also help you close candidates by getting on the phone with them and sharing why investors like us are excited about your company.

NETWORK
* We'll make intros to other founders, domain experts, functional experts, investors, and anyone else in our network that you want to talk to.
* For b2b companies, we will help you reach early customers through our 1st and 2nd degree network.

DISCOUNTS
* We have discounts with lots of service providers, and for commonly used tools (public clouds, ATS and CRM software, productivity tools, etc.)
