* **Check Size**: $250k-$500k at pre-seed, $500k-$1m at seed. Series A's are too late for us.
* **Valuation Range**: >90% of our investments are at $25m post money or less. On occasion, we will invest at valuations a little north of $25m.
* **Geographies**: Companies HQ'ed in the US or Canada.
* **Sectors/Themes**: We're open to anything that's deep tech or in nationally important sectors like manufacturing and defense (a.k.a. American Dynamism). We've [recently invested](https://humbaventures.com/#portfolio) in areas ranging from autonomous defense, warehouse robotics, and manufacturing, to biotech platforms, next gen power plants, and isotope enrichment. One of the few areas we avoid is biotech companies that are developing a single asset instead of a platform.
* **Nice to haves**:
  * *Outlier founders* -- We gravitate toward spiky founders that are top 0.1% in something (work-related or otherwise) rather than top 20% in a lot of things.
  * *Founder/market fit* -- The more esoteric and complex the target market, the more we like to see founder/market fit.
  * *Underserved opportunity* -- The biggest opportunities are when customers are unserved or underserved, not when they are well served and you can provide a solution that's a few percent better.
  * *Relatively capital light* -- Ideally a company doesn't have to wait until a Series C or later to get its first customers.
