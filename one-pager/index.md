## Focus areas
- climate and energy
- robotics and manufacturing
- defense and cybersecurity

We're open-minded and have invested in other areas like AI-enabled drug discovery and decentralized exchanges.

## Process
Our process is typically 3 meetings:
- intro meeting with 1 investor
- follow-up meeting with 1-2 investors
- final meeting with 2 investors

In parallel, if we know domain experts or potential customers that are especially relevant to your business, we'll introduce you to them during the due diligence process.

A typical diligence timeline is 1.5-2 weeks.

## What we look for in potential investments

There are no hard and fast rules when it comes to building or investing in startups, but below are some company and founder qualities that we love to see.

- Spiky founders -- are you top 1% or even top 0.01% in something that you do?
- Founder/market fit -- the more esoteric and challenging the sector you're in, the more we like to see past experience with the sector and with your target customers.
- Deliberate decision making -- we love founders that have navigated the [idea maze](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and can articulate the reasoning behind major strategic decisions they've made.
- Not overly capital intensive -- the less capital you need to get your product into customers' hands, the more of a fit we will be.

## Ethics
Ethics and integrity are very important to us. We wonâ€™t invest in your competitors, wonâ€™t share your deck with them, and wonâ€™t share their decks with you. 

As a matter of principle, we always strive to make recommendations that are in the best interest of the company, not ourselves.
