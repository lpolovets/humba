# Why Humba?

* We have 2x the follow-on rate vs the industry average (~70% of companies we work with raise a follow-on round, vs. 30-35% for early stage startups in general)
* Being part of the broader Susa Ventures fund family (~$800m AUM) gives us outsized resources: online talks from expert speakers, negotiated software and service provider discounts, office space that you can use in SF if you're coming in from out of town, etc. Humba's check size is that of a $40m fund, but our resources are similar to those of a $100m+ fund.
* Being part of the Susa fund family also gives us a huge combined network. This can be helpful for finding experts, investors, customers, etc.
* Leo is a technical VC (Caltech BS, 10 years as a software engineer), so he can discuss opportunities and challenges that are hard to cover with non-technical investors.
* Leo was one of the first engineers at several startups ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Factual](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/factual){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}), and the combination of that experience and a VC's perspective makes him especially effective at helping to close key job candidates.
* We are engaged but not meddlesome. We're non-judgmental and supportive whether things are going well or you're struggling, and founders love working with us :)
