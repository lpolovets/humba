# Why Humba?

* We have 2x the follow-on rate vs the industry average (~70% of companies we work with raise a follow-on round, vs. 30-35% for early stage startups in general)
* Being part of the broader Susa Ventures fund family (~$800m AUM) gives us outsized resources: online talks from expert speakers, negotiated software and service provider discounts, office space that you can use in SF if you're coming in from out of town, etc. Humba's check size is that of a $40m fund, but our resources are similar to those of a $100m+ fund.
* The Humba+Susa team have a very large combined network, which can be helpful for finding experts, investors, customers, etc.
* Leo is a technical VC (Caltech BS, 10 years as a software engineer, still thinks and reasons like a software engineer despite being rusty ðŸ˜…), so he can discuss opportunities and challenges that are hard to cover with non-technical investors.
* Leo was one of the first engineers at several startups ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} and [Factual](https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/factual){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}), and the combination of that experience and a VC's perspective makes him especially effective at helping to close key job candidates.
* Humba guarantees 20% of its initial investment into your next priced round, as long as that round give you at least 18 months of runway. E.g. if we invested $500k into your seed round, we promise to invest $100k in your Series A. This approach has a few important implications:
    * This sends a positive signal to next round's investors -- or at least doesn't send a negative one -- because we are going to participate in the next round regardless of the terms or who the lead is, as long as the round gives you a reasonable amount of runway.
    * We are going to be diluted along with you over the life of your company. This will be less dilutive to you over time than other funds that focus heavily on pro rata or super pro rata in future rounds.
    * We are aligned from day one. We are not writing "option checks" where we want to see how things play out before putting in a lot more capital; we are investing because we believe in you and our vision today.
* We are engaged but not meddlesome. We're non-judgmental and supportive whether things are going well or you're struggling, and founders love working with us.
